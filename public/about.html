    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>
        Organized, responsible and proactive individual, with high team communication values and able to relocate. In 2015, as an undergraduate, I had the opportunity to work and learn in a soil and concrete lab for commercial and academic purposes. That same year I started working with the company MAKRO CONSTRUCTION as a Surveyor Tech and Survey Crew Manager Assistant. With them I was in charge of Field Reports, Field Data Processing, Legal Descriptions, construction of culverts and all plan and profile related drawings.

        In May 2016 I started with the company CONNISA CONULTORIA as a Junior Civil Engineer, where I was in charge of several phases of bidding processes for projects, reviewing costs, earthwork and dirt grading design, and also worked in the supervision of all Storm-drain constructions for the related projects.

        In August 2017 I started a position with the company INSTALACIONES EMMANUEL that focused mainly in vertical commercial buildings. There I was a Site supervisor and I was also in charge of estimates, costs and some phases of the bidding process.

        From October 2019 to this day, I work as a Civil Engineer and Civil Supervisor for the FISCALIA GENERAL DE JUSTICIA DEL ESTADO DE SONORA, a State Public entity from the government, that among several other multi-disciplinary branches, is in charge of the building permits, specifications and zoning for the Mexican state of Sonora.

        I really enjoy learning new things, so my goal is a challenging and dynamic position where I can share my experience and add new knowledge.
